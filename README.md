This repository explores Natural Language processing by building a NLP Model to analyze twitter sentiments about Apple and Google Products.

## Data
We used a dataset from [data.world provided by CrowdFlower](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions) which contains 9,093 tweets about Apple and Google from the South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference. The tweet labels were crowdsourced and reflect which emotion they convey and what product/service/company this emotion is directed at based on the content.
